# Image Paste Support

Yeet now supports pasting images from clipboard for use with vision-capable models.

## How to Use

1. **Copy an image** to your clipboard (screenshot, copy image from browser, etc.)

2. **In yeet**, press `Ctrl-V` to paste the image

3. You'll see confirmation: `[Image #1 attached]`

4. **Type your message** and press Enter

5. The image will be sent along with your message to the model

## Example

```
> Ctrl-V (paste image)
[Image #1 attached]
> what's in this image?
You: what's in this image? [1 image(s)]
