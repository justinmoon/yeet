# Real Terminal Test

## The Problem
Test renderer shows clean output but actual terminal has overlapping content.

## What I Changed
- Wrapped TextRenderable in BoxRenderable before adding to ScrollBox
- This matches how OpenTUI examples structure ScrollBox content

## Test Results
✅ All 19 tests pass
✅ E2E test with real API looks clean in `captureCharFrame()`
⚠️  But test renderer might not show same bugs as actual terminal

## To Test
Run the actual app:
```bash
cd ~/code/yeet
bun run src/index.ts
```

Type: "list files"

If still broken, I need:
1. Screenshot of what you see
2. Description of what's overlapping
3. Terminal size (echo $COLUMNS $LINES)
